# nodejs-demo-app
This Project is all about implementing Github CICD for Node.js based application

# Overview:
Automate the deployment of a Node.js web app using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

Tech Stack & Tools:
Node.js â€“ Web application 

Docker â€“ Containerize the application

GitHub Actions â€“ CI/CD pipeline

GitHub Self-hosted Runner â€“ Run the pipeline on EC2 instance

Steps Performed:
Created Node.js web app

Created a simple app in index.js with express to return Hello from Node.js!.

Used package.json to define dependencies.

Dockerized the Application

Created a Dockerfile to containerize the app

Exposed port 3000

Created GitHub Workflow (CI/CD)

Created .github/workflows/main.yml

# Workflow steps:

1. Checkout code

2. Set up Node.js environment

3. Install dependencies

4. Build and run Docker container and push to docker hub

After developing and dockerizing the Node.js application, I initially tested the CI/CD pipeline using a GitHub hosted runner. The workflow executed successfully, verifying the build process and Docker container run through the GitHub Actions tab. Once confirmed I proceeded to configure a self-hosted runner on my local machine. I registered the runner with the repository via the GitHub settings and reran the workflow, which again executed successfully on the self hosted runner.

To securely manage sensitive information, I stored necessary credentials and configuration values in GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ New Repository Secrets under Secrets and variables. These were then accessed within the workflow using the secrets context. 

Finally, I verified that the Docker container was running as expected and confirmed the application was accessible at http://<EC2-publicip>:3000.
